Piccolo API
===========

Piccolo API makes it easy to turn your `Piccolo ORM <https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
tables into a working REST API, using ASGI.

It also includes a bunch of essential middleware for building a production
ASGI app, covering authentication, security, and more.
